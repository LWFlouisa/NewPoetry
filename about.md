Welcome to my poetry blog. Here this reflects the current era of my poetry style. I'm a science fiction and horror writer at heart, but have gradually come to prefer science fiction. When I'm not writing, you can find me at a local coffee shop having a Latte or French Press. Or going to various techware stores for thumb drives.

The neckstitch represents the fact that characters in my science fiction, while beheading is the default method of capital punishment, often don't die from the decapitation, and often have their heads kept on life support in tanks. So it is that I remain attached to Rock, but just by a thread.
