The midnight train<br />
ascends up railway wire...<br />
Winter snowflakes.

On this long road<br />
of harrowing depth<br />
ascends.<br />
Artificial<br />
Light lasts all night long.<br />
Gazing.<br />
Holding hands with my<br />
mistress, riding on.<br />
Sleeping.

The midnight train<br />
ascends up railway wire...<br />
Winter snowflakes.

The sounding flute<br />
hums its farewell tune...<br />
Winter snowflakes.

To think that in all<br />
my life, I can't<br />
think of<br />
A time I've been<br />
With my mistress this<br />
long wait.<br />
And on this train<br />
I long await<br />
trainstop.

The distinction between ascending<br />
And the world of descending,<br />
Is lost in a blurry slog,<br />
Where Yomi awaits, if even that,<br />
Into a world of eternal darkness.

The railway continues<br />
Into the path of darkness.<br />
As if spiriting away.
