At night the rain<br />
drops, pouring again falling...<br />
winter moonlight.

At night I walk<br />
the forest roadway, dampened with<br />
The blood of necks.<br />
Severed heads from women<br />
of revolutions gone by.<br />
The oblique blade of doom.<br />
At night I walk.

Reve Diminuee<br />
How I want release<br />
from my nightmares.

In the forest<br />
I am not alone, but with<br />
An evil tree<br />
starring at me in the window<br />
fading in from a beam<br />
of light. Goodnight real world night.<br />
In the forest.

It stares forth<br />
at me as if it knows<br />
my inner secrets.

At other times, one wanders<br />
A house that is like a universe of its own.<br />
An uncharted path of rooms.<br />
With an unseen something, you can sense.<br />
Behind your back.

At night I walk<br />
the forest roadway, dampened with<br />
The blood of necks.<br />
Severed heads from women<br />
of revolutions gone by.<br />
The oblique blade of doom.<br />
At night I walk.

Fleeing this creatures,<br />
that I cannot see,
