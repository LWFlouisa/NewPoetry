Once upon a<br />
a midnight dream I witness<br />
trophy heads upon<br />
a wall at cozy circus.<br />
But without clowns of blood.

"Can you help us found our bodies,<br />
Or do you think we're nobodies?",<br />
they say, beckoning me forth.

In this cozy circus<br />
there were cybernetics.

In this midnight dream<br />
was the national razor<br />
with a freshly severed head.<br />
But it was not a murderer or a clown.

"Can you help me find my body,<br />
Or do you think I'm a nobody?",<br />
the severed head said.

A severed head,<br />
of some previous tourist.<br />
She stole some cotton candy,<br />
and a pair of wooden shoes.

As I turned around,<br />
this was no circus, but an office,<br />
For preserving heads<br />
of tourists, thinking it was a stageshow,<br />
Of clowns without a presence.

All those heads follow me around,<br />
starring at me from the walls.<br />
Cybernetic girls without their robot bodies.

And once new body built,<br />
Wore strange wooden shoes.<br />
My cybernetic clown dream girls.
