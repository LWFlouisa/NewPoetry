## THE LIFE IN BLACK AND RED
Rose and black, a life in darkest midnight.<br />
Rose and black, a falling sun in red bleeding.<br />
The midnight starlight bleeds into<br />
a rainy and stormy visit<br />
to a secret lost to time.<br />
Rose and black.

Life in Red Black<br />
with trees lurking over...<br />
the crow sits on sign:

"Here lies the roadway,<br />
filled with many secrets.<br />
Some that wish to stay a mystery.<br />
If you dare to come closer,<br />
to see the world with new eyes,<br />
you may observe the many lies around you."

Rose and black, a life in darkest midnight.<br />
Rose and black, a falling sun in red bleeding.<br />
The midnight starlight bleeds into<br />
a rainy and stormy visit<br />
to a secret lost to time.<br />
Rose and black.

Im dont know what waits,<br />
if I walk past the wooden sign,<br />
Life in rose and black.

Thus if I must explore,<br />
a secret world, and find out things<br />
mankind was never meant to know,<br />
please think of me.

My darling, Anna-Marie.
