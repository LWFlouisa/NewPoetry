THE LIFE IN BLACK AND RED

Rose and black, a life in darkest midnight.
Rose and black, a falling sun in red bleeding.
The midnight starlight bleeds into
a rainy and stormy visit
to a secret lost to time.
Rose and black.

Life in Red Black
with trees lurking over...
the crow sits on sign:

"Here lies the roadway,
filled with many secrets.
Some that wish to stay a mystery.
If you dare to come closer,
to see the world with new eyes,
you may observe the many lies around you."

Rose and black, a life in darkest midnight.
Rose and black, a falling sun in red bleeding.
The midnight starlight bleeds into
a rainy and stormy visit
to a secret lost to time.
Rose and black.

Im dont know what waits,
if I walk past the wooden sign,
Life in rose and black.

Thus if I must explore,
a secret world, and find out things
mankind was never meant to know,
please think of me.

My darling, Anna-Marie.
