## MAIDEN'S SCREAM

Only a month<br />
sense she lost her ginger locks.<br />
Only a month<br />
sense her looks others knew not<br />
any other lass of compare.<br />
Blue eyes, strawberry hair.<br />
Only a month.

Blood is bleeding<br />
from tender swan like neck...<br />
cherry blossoms.

It took a single strike<br />
to make the killing blow.<br />
As easily as being tossed off a bike,<br />
her bruises were not just for show.<br />
The oblique edge made its strike,<br />
And dealt its lethal blow.

Memories death<br />
fades quickly into the dust.<br />
Memories death<br />
bleeding from blade of dust.<br />
As we rot, we become dust<br />
buried under the gallows tree.<br />
Memories death.

Blood is bleeding<br />
from tender swan like neck...<br />
cherry blossoms.

If only we could dream,<br />
of a fairer world,<br />
perhaps we shall never see,<br />
the deaths of brides to be.

And witness the death of swans,<br />
and a maidenâ€™s scream.
