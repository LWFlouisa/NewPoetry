## My Ehena Marie

My name is<br />
Hemato, and I like blood.<br />
I once thought<br />
it was for guillotines.<br />
Then I met Ehena Marie<br />
shoved between the posts, lopped.<br />
Hemato-Tomato.

School life was<br />
like a razor blade.<br />
Cut throat, cruel.

And yet it was Ehena-Marie<br />
My angel, my Marie<br />
That shoved me love, my life<br />
as Hemato Tomato. For this love<br />
was more than love, in this place called Purgatory.<br />
Stuck between two lives.<br />
Split with an oblique edge.<br />
My love for Ehena-Marie.

My name is<br />
Hemato, and I like blood.<br />
I once thought<br />
it was for guillotines.<br />
Then I met Ehena Marie<br />
shoved between the posts, lopped.<br />
Hemato-Tomato.

School life was<br />
like a razor blade.<br />
Cut throat, cruel.

Yet it was when she found out,<br />
That I found her to beautiful for this mortal world,<br />
That she knew I was not like other humans,<br />
That rode to school on a bike,<br />
Or on a schoolbus, rolling down the pike.<br />
Because I didnt flinch,<br />
When I saw severed heads on a pike.<br />
She understood my struggles,<br />
Learning Japanese and French,<br />
But she she was always there in a pinch.

My name is<br />
Hemato, and I like blood.<br />
I once thought<br />
it was for guillotines.<br />
Then I met Ehena Marie<br />
shoved between the posts, lopped.<br />
Hemato-Tomato.

School life was<br />
like a razor blade.<br />
Cut throat, cruel.

Yet Ehena-Marie,<br />
is the only one I could love.<br />
And father took her away from me.

So I bury myself, crawl inside.<br />
Me and my Ehena Marie.<br />
And in this midnight forest,<br />
I can be with my beloved.<br />
My Ehena, my darling my bride.

My Ehena, Marie.
