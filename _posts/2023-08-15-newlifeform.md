I drink my own blood<br />
bow down to your new Queen,<br />
Your new dracula.

Blood drinking is an adaptation,<br />
While the French perfected a contraption.

I drink my own blood<br />
when no vampires are left.<br />
And humans when I have to.

Humans cant handle difference,<br />
While there is nothing uniting<br />
The creatures of the night.

I drink my own blood<br />
bow down to your new Queen,<br />
Your new dracula.

But at least I dont synthesize lifeform,<br />
made of silicone and stolen artwork.

Its people like this,<br />
That make me miss.<br />
Times when there was no humans.

When it was just vampires,<br />
there was warring tribes.<br />
With humans there are only diatribes,<br />
and cheap knock of wind chimes.

But we were here before you.
And I wont be the last.
