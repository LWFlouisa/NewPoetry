Midnight Christmas,<br />
All the toys fall to pieces.<br />
Midnight Christmas,<br />
before the arsenic<br />
slips into the bloodstream.<br />
And razor blade falls on you.<br />
  Tonight.<br />
Midnight Christmas.

On this road<br />
of spiraling crypts<br />
The fading sun now washes out.

It was long ago, when she stabbed<br />
her brother with a knife.<br />
Before letting him fall down,<br />
Waiting for the poison to slip in.

Midnight Christmas,<br />
All the toys fall to pieces.<br />
Midnight Christmas,<br />
before the arsenic<br />
slips into the bloodstream.<br />
And razor blade falls on you.<br />
  Tonight.<br />
Midnight Christmas.

But it was her boyfriend<br />
That let her lose her head,<br />
And let her severed neck rest on.

At midnight Christmas,<br />
where the ghouls come to sleep,<br />
and rest their final rest.
