Morning train<br />
wooshes by at lightning speed.<br />
Morning train<br />
rushes by, deafening necks bleeding<br />
when decaped by guillotine<br />
silenced by the train tracks.<br />
Morning train.

Bleeding from the neck<br />
the blood wooshes out quickly<br />
as one led to stairs.

Off goes the head at lightning speed,<br />
Before the morning comes, one is given weed,<br />
And nothing else, as ones last meal,<br />
While the prison guards eat veal.<br />
Off goes the head at lightning speed,<br />
When the oblique blade drops.<br />
Flying off goes the wooden shoes,<br />
Donated to the Museum,<br />
A newly founded venture by the French queen at Neo-Imperial France.<br />
If only the victim knew, that it would be this queen,<br />
That would be the only one to go.<br />
At lightining speed.

Morning train<br />
wooshes by at lightning speed.<br />
Morning train<br />
rushes by, deafening necks bleeding<br />
when decaped by guillotine<br />
silenced by the train tracks.<br />
Morning train.

Bleeding quickly, the<br />
blade drops in the morning,<br />
as one led to stairs.

Silenced by the train,<br />
Going quickly by.
