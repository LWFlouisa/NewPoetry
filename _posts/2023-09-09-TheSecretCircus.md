## The Secret Circus
Secret Circus<br />
in the center of town hiding.<br />
Secret Circus,<br />
the weeping willow crying<br />
in a secret part of circus<br />
with guillotines and gallows.<br />
Secret Circus.

The midnight moon<br />
hovering overhead...<br />
broken by ravens.

In this secret circus, where the clowns tap dance,<br />
And Raggity Ann dolls in Birkenstocks<br />
Wind up the midnight clocks at midnight hour,<br />
the bagguette thief is placed in the stocks.<br />
A droning accordion hums its tones.<br />
THe demons leap out from the keyboard,<br />
Like evil children coming out to play.<br />
With hair over their eyes, beckoning you to the television.

Secret Circus<br />
in the center of town hiding.<br />
Secret Circus,<br />
the weeping willow crying<br />
in a secret part of circus<br />
with guillotines and gallows.v
Secret Circus.

Built over by<br />
modern Frenchmen, a toast<br />
to beheaded...

In the years gone by.<br />
But donâ€™t forget the children.<br />
With the hair over their eyes,<br />
Because the secret circus shall rise again.
