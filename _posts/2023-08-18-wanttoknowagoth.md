Lets have a smash,<br />
At the funeral party.<br />
The dance of ghouls of delight.<br />
While we live to enjoy the night.

You want to know<br />
the difference between<br />
Metal and Goth rock?

Suppose we had a family,<br />
make them friends of six or nine people.

We are a riding<br />
along a busy roadway<br />
on skateboards.<br />
Riding along with the back.<br />
One three stays far behind.

The other speeds right ahead.<br />
For Goths we are normal<br />
In that we lag behind to pick up a friend,<br />
Overweight doesn't matter,<br />
A friend is a friend.

But unlike we normies,<br />
We while we retrieve the crahsed friend<br />
riding along his skateboard,<br />
We also admire gods unruly brutal work.

When the other group speeds along,<br />
as smashes against a toad.<br />
There splat is both the metalhead and the tpad.

But that splatter fascinates us,<br />
Not do to any particular anjoyment of death itself.<br />
But because of how fragile life can be,<br />
We your blind with aggression.

Even if that's all metalheads know.

But also we're dancing on graveyards,<br />
Eating picnics at the same funeral party,<br />
as our friend smashing against the toad.<br />
At eighty miles an hour.

Lets have a smash.
