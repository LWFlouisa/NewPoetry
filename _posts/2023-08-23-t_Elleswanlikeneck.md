## ELLE, SWANLIKE GRACE
VERSE<br />
She is a head<br />
severed from swanlike neck.<br />
Frail and pretty.<br />
Like ghost of elegance.<br />
Elle, ghost of elegance.

CHORUS<br />
Hair like flowers,<br />
daisies on gravestone.<br />
I caress her face,<br />
As I shiver in cold.<br />
Daisies on gravestone.

VERSE<br />
From any angle,<br />
She exhibits angelic grace.<br />
As her blood pours on my shirt.<br />
Lips treated delicately.<br />
Elle, angel of grace.

CHORUS<br />
Hair like flowers,<br />
daisies on gravestone.<br />
I caress her face,<br />
As I shiver in cold.<br />
Daisies on gravestone.

BRIDGE<br />
Dust to dust,<br />
angels slowly withers in arms,<br />
like chains of rust,<br />
as I die within this heavenly caress.

Angel of grace,<br />
Angel of rust.<br />
Life like love,<br />
turned to dust.

VERSE<br />
She was not ugly,<br />
Or particularly beautiful.<br />
But she was my type.<br />
Angel of rust and grace.

I gently wipe away,<br />
the tears from her away.

CHORUS<br />
Hair like flowers,<br />
daisies on gravestone.<br />
I caress her face,<br />
As I shiver in cold.<br />
Daisies on gravestone.

VERSE<br />
Dust to dust<br />
I wither away in to time,<br />
like rust to dust.
