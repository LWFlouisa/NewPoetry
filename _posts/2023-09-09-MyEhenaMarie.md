## My Ehena Marie

My name is
Hemato, and I like blood.
I once thought
it was for guillotines.
Then I met Ehena Marie
shoved between the posts, lopped.
Hemato-Tomato.

School life was
like a razor blade.
Cut throat, cruel.

And yet it was Ehena-Marie
My angel, my Marie
That shoved me love, my life
as Hemato Tomato. For this love
was more than love, in this place called Purgatory.
Stuck between two lives.
Split with an oblique edge.
My love for Ehena-Marie.

My name is
Hemato, and I like blood.
I once thought
it was for guillotines.
Then I met Ehena Marie
shoved between the posts, lopped.
Hemato-Tomato.

School life was
like a razor blade.
Cut throat, cruel.

Yet it was when she found out,
That I found her to beautiful for this mortal world,
That she knew I was not like other humans,
That rode to school on a bike,
Or on a schoolbus, rolling down the pike.
Because I didnt flinch,
When I saw severed heads on a pike.
She understood my struggles,
Learning Japanese and French,
But she she was always there in a pinch.

My name is
Hemato, and I like blood.
I once thought
it was for guillotines.
Then I met Ehena Marie
shoved between the posts, lopped.
Hemato-Tomato.

School life was
like a razor blade.
Cut throat, cruel.

Yet Ehena-Marie,
is the only one I could love.
And father took her away from me.

She I bury myself, crawl inside.
Me and my Ehena Marie.
And in this midnight forest,
I can be with my beloved.
My Ehena, my darling my bride.

My Ehena, Marie.
