## Midnight Music Class

After school<br />
in the music room I eat.<br />
After school<br />
with a piano, other door<br />
opens, to another room<br />
that beckons me closer to play.<br />
After school.

The other students<br />
wait quietly, day ends...<br />
moon rises up.

At midnight, the ghouls on the walls<br />
turn from stone to life.<br />
And play with moonlight like its<br />
studio night. I long, for your embrace<br />
Under the shining moonlight.<br />
The werewolf howls for you and me.<br />
The guillotine, on the scaffold,<br />
beckons for you and me.

After school<br />
in the music room I eat.<br />
After school<br />
with a piano, other door<br />
opens, to another room<br />
that beckons me closer to play.<br />
After school.

And as I play song<br />
of ghouls and goblins, I wait<br />
for closing moonlight.

For you and me, like monsters at night,<br />
the humans despise us because we're different.<br />
But lets be different together.
And cuddle under a gallows tree.
