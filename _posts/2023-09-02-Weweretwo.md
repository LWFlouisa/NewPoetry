We were two<br />
lovers split apart, worlds away.<br />
We were two<br />
lovers miles apart, to think<br />
theat all it took, mistakes<br />
to take our bond away.<br />
We were two.

Somedays I still<br />
miss you, walking bridges...<br />
Sunlight fades red.

There was so much split<br />
that took our souls astray.<br />
Were were trauma bond,<br />
And hugged each other on this day.<br />
I wished we could have stayed<br />
together for at least another day.<br />
And yet twas never to me,<br />
But darling lopsided bow.

We were two<br />
lovers bound together in pain.<br />
We were two<br />
lovers with painful memories<br />
of severed heads and hands.<br />
Living dolls, bleak necromancy.<br />
We were two.

Somedays I still<br />
miss you, walking bridges...<br />
Sunlight fades red.

And yet it is with regret,<br />
That are yet another,<br />
Doll lost in the wind.
