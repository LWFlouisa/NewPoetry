Christmas tree<br />
O Christmass tree, o the dim lights.<br />
Christmas tree<br />
with your tear shaped ornament.<br />
Can you grant me, one final wish.<br />
That you’ll be with me as I sleep.<br />
Christmas tree.

The rain falling<br />
overhead, kisses my skin.<br />
A tingling touch.

It was you oh Christmas tree,<br />
with your tear shaped ornaments,<br />
and your mocking gaze, all night long,<br />
that comforted me tonight.<br />
May you also have a goodnight too.<br />
With your stockings of charcoal,<br />
and some vague hope of candy within.

Christmas tree<br />
O Christmass tree, o the dim lights.<br />
Christmas tree<br />
with your tear shaped ornament.<br />
Can you grant me, one final wish.<br />
That you’ll be with me as I sleep.<br />
Christmas tree.

You have been a<br />
great friend to me.<br />
Now I wish you audieu.<br />
As I fade tonight.
