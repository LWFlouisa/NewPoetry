I make death<br />
payed in blood by hour.<br />
I make death<br />
payed with her swan like neck,<br />
reclining on shoulders sleeping.<br />
Her eyes fade to darkness.<br />
I make death.

There is no world<br />
that is fit for you and me<br />
my dear bride.

Dangling down the chimney, on the wires.<br />
Blood dripping into my mouth entire,<br />
Our lips meet under a full moons shine.<br />
For you my wife so divine, my darling angel<br />
Out in the nick of time, before your time.<br />
Tender fragile kisses, my bride of percelain.<br />
Dangling down the chimeny, on the wires,<br />
My soul consumed entire.<br />
The massochism of needles and rust.

I make death<br />
payed in blood by hour.<br />
I make death<br />
payed with her swan like neck,<br />
reclining on shoulders sleeping.<br />
Her eyes fade to darkness.<br />
I make death.

There is no world<br />
that is fit for you and me<br />
my dear bride.

But I make death, not by force of armies,<br />
or the anguish of the oppressed and righteous.<br />
But by the guillotine blades,<br />
dangling on the wire.

For you, my divinity,
My wife of percelain and wine.
